        <a title="Wikipedia" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeigarnik_effect">Zeigarnik Effect</a> is a psychological tendency to remember <strong>an <u>uncompleted</u> task</strong> rather than a completed one.

        The Zeigarnik effect was named after its founder, Russian psychiatrist and psychologist Bluma Wulfovna Zeigarnik. While dining at a restaurant in the 1920s, Zeigarnik noticed waiters were able to keep track of complex orders and unpaid meals, but once the orders were filled and paid for, the waiters were unable to recall detailed information about the orders. Intrigued, she decided to study the phenomenon via a series of experiments in her lab.
